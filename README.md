# LPG-CONSUMPTION-DETECTOR-

## Overview

LPG-CONSUMPTION-DETECTOR- is a safety-focused project designed to monitor LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) consumption and detect potential leaks in real time. The system is equipped with an intelligent leak detection mechanism that instantly notifies users via Twilio SMS when a leak is suspected. By continuously tracking consumption, it enhances the safety and reliability of LPG installations in residential, commercial, or industrial environments.

## Features

- **Real-Time Leak Detection:** Monitors LPG usage and identifies unusual consumption patterns that may indicate a leak.
- **Instant SMS Alerts:** Integrates with Twilio to send immediate notifications to users for rapid response.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Ensures persistent safety oversight by tracking LPG flow and usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Twilio API:** For SMS notification delivery.
- **Sensor Integration:** Interfaces with hardware sensors to measure LPG consumption.
- **Python/Embedded Systems:** (Specify language/platform used in your implementation.)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Obila34/LPG-CONSUMPTION-DETECTOR-.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies (add details here, e.g., Python packages or hardware requirements).

3. Configure Twilio credentials for SMS notifications:
   - Obtain your Twilio account SID and Auth Token.
   - Set them in the project configuration file.

4. Connect the LPG sensor hardware according to the wiring instructions (include schematic or documentation if available).

## Usage

- Run the main monitoring script or firmware.
- The system will begin tracking LPG consumption and analyzing for potential leaks.
- If a leak is detected, an SMS alert will be sent to the userâ€™s configured phone number.
